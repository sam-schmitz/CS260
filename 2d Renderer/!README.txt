This 2d renderer was made during my CS260 class (Computer Graphics). This 2d renderer was our introduction to the cource and as such is less complicated than it's 3d counterpart. The images created can be viewed using ppmview.py. Just enter python3 ppmview.py (filename) to view one of the images. 

The renderer is made using the following:
